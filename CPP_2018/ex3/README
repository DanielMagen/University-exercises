answers
1) "in whice state the program runs faster?"
the eigen library is overwhelmingly faster. this difference is due to eigen use
of threads and special optimizations techniques. the difference between the 2 sets of data
in our program is evident, our program runs slower the bigger the matrix is. 
the eigen library however is almot not affected.

2) "is there a difference between the addition and multiplication, why?"
there is a clear difference between the time it took to preform the multiplication
and the time it took to preform the addition in our program. however the eigen library is vastly less affected.
this difference is due to our naive implementation of the multiplication operation. 
our program multiplication is O(n^3) while eigen uses better algorithms and also multithreading 
to achieve vastly better performance.
