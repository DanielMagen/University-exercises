tzia,
Student Daniel Magen (), Student GAl Batzia ()
EX: 1

FILES:
osm.cpp -- a file that holds function for measuring running times. The measuring operations are addition, a call to an empty function and a system call.
osm.h -- a header file for the .cpp file above.
README -- this file.
times.png -- the results graph.
Makefile -- a file that runs the compiled project.

REMARKS:
we run the osm program a couple of times with more than 100,000 operations each

ANSWERS:

Q1:
the program creates/overides a file called "OS2018" in the directory Welcome/To (it creates the directory if it doesn't exist)

next it checks using "fstat" command that the "file" is actually a file and that it has size 0 
then is writes to the file a message which addresses the student, after which it writes the given input to the file also.
for example with the input "1000" we get:
\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n1000

later it closes the file and deletes the file and the folders it has created
