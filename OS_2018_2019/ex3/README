FILES:
Barrier.cpp -- a class used by MapReduceFramework to block access to the reduce stage until
all are finished with the map and sort stage
Barrier.h -- an .h file for the Barrier class

GlobalVariables.cpp -- a class used to hold all the data that needs to be shared among all
workers of the MapReduceFramework
GlobalVariables.h -- an .h file for the GlobalVariables class

JobContext.cpp -- a class that is used as the JobHandle for the MapReduceFramework. it uses
GlobalVariables in order to access most of the data.
JobContext.h -- an .h file for the JobContext class

ThreadContext.cpp -- a class which holds all the data that is relevant for a given thread.
it uses GlobalVariables in order to access most of the data that is shared among threads.
ThreadContext.h -- an .h file for the ThreadContext class

ShuffleThreadContext.cpp -- an extension to ThreadContext to enable more functionality for the
thread that is responsible for the shuffling stage
ShuffleThreadContext.h -- an .h file for the ShuffleThreadContext class

MapReduceFramework.cpp -- the requested implementation of the MapReduceFramework library

Makefile - a makefile for the requested library

README - this file


REMARKS:
to avoid unnecessary memory usage by JobContext and ThreadContext, we decided that rather than
inheriting from GlobalVariables, the given classes wil instead hold a pointer to a shared
GlobalVariables object while overriding needed functions as need be.

None
