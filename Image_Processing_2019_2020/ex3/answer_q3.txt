when we decrease the max_level the difference between the two separate
images in the overall blended image becomes more visible.
this is because when we decrease the max_level what we do is in fact much
closer to just overlay the images on top on another than to use the pyramid blending
technique. this is because as such when we combine the 2 images
together we end up combining them without taking into account the finer distinction
between them at the relevant points, which in turn makes the two separate
images in the overall blended image becomes more visible.
