when we increase the image filter the difference between the two separate
images in the overall blended image becomes more visible.
this is because when we increase the image filter without increasing the max level
we blur the image more in each step of creating the gaussian pyramid which in turn
makes the laplacian pyramid hold more data about the overall structure of the image, and
less data about the more fine details of the image. as such when we combine the 2 images
together we end up combining them without taking into account the finer distinction
between them at the relevant points, which in turn makes the two separate
images in the overall blended image becomes more visible.
