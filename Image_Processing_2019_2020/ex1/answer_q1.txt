the quantization procedure will crash if we have a gray
level (z_i - z_(i+1)) with no pixels because when we
will try to calculate the next q_i in the optimization procedure,
the denominator which would be the sum of the gray levels between z_i - z_(i+1)
would be 0 and as a result we would get a division by 0 error and crash
