the change_samples function removes the information about the
high frequencies that influence the sound heard. as such the output
of change_samples has a different sound from the original.

in contrast, the change_rate function does not remove any information
but just increases the sampling rate. as such no information is lost,
but the pitch becomes greater since now the frequencies in the audio were doubled.
