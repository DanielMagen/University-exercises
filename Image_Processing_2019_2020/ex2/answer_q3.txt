when we take the derivative using the fourier transform we
take into account all the pixels of the image.
this is because all of the pixels influence each fourier coefficient.

on the other hand, when we take the derivative using the convolution
method presented here, for each pixel we take into account only its nearest neighbors.

as such the two methods are different and yield different results
